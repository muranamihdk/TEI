"Many documents, both historical and contemporary, include not only text, but "
"also graphics, artwork, and other images. Although some types of images can "
"be represented directly with markup, it is more common practice to include "
"such information by using a reference to an external entity (typically a "
"URL) encoded in a suitable graphical notation."

"In addition to graphic images, documents often contain material presented in "

"A table is the least <_:soCalled-1/> of the elements discussed in this "

"columns: one might, for example, choose to show a glossary or other form of "
"list in tabular form, without necessarily regarding it as a table. In such "
"cases, the global <_:att-2/> attribute is an appropriate way of indicating "
"that some element is being presented in tabular format, for example by using "
"an appropriate display property in CSS. When tabular presentation is "
"regarded as of less intrinsic importance, it is correspondingly simpler to "

"first row from left to right, then the second row, and so on. Details of "
"appearance such as column widths, border lines, and alignment are generally "
"encoded by numerous attributes. Beyond this, however, such schemas differ "

"PNG is a non-proprietary raster format currently widely available. It "
"provides an extensible file format for the lossless, portable, well-"
"compressed storage of raster images. Indexed-color, grayscale, and truecolor "
"images are supported, plus an optional alpha channel. Sample depths range "
"from 1 to 16 bits. It is defined by IETF RFC 2083, March 1997."

"Currently the most widely supported raster image format, especially for "
"black and white images, TIFF is also one of the few formats commonly "
"supported on more than one operating system. The drawback to TIFF is that it "
"actually is a wrapper for several formats, and some TIFF-supporting software "
"does not support all variants. TIFF files may use LZW, CCITT Group 4, or "
"PackBits compression methods, or may use no compression at all. Also, TIFF "
"files may be monochrome, grayscale, or polychromatic. All such options "
"should be specified in prose at the end of the <_:gi-1/> section of the TEI "
"header for any document including TIFF images. TIFF is owned by Aldus "
"Corporation. Documentation on TIFF is available from them at Craigcook "

"SMIL is a W3C Recommendation which supports the integration of independent "
"multimedia objects into a synchronized multimedia presentation. It provides "
"multimedia authors with easily-defined basic timing relationships, fine-"
"tuned synchronization, spatial layout, direct inclusion of non-text and non-"
"image media objects, hyperlink support for time-based media, and "
"adaptiveness to varying user and system characteristics. SMIL 1.0 (<_:ptr-1/"
">) became a W3C Recommendation on June 15, 1998, and was further developed "
"in SMIL 2.0. SMIL 2.0 adds native support for transitions, animation, event-"
"based interaction, extended layout facilities, and more sophisticated timing "
"and synchronization primitives to the SMIL 1.0 language. It also allows "
"reuse of SMIL syntax and semantics in other XML-based languages, in "
"particular those who need to represent timing and synchronization. For "
"example, SMIL 2.0 components are used for integrating timing into XHTML "
"Document Types and into SVG. SMIL 2.0 also provides recommendations for "
"Document Types based on SMIL 2.0 Modules (<_:ptr-2/>). One such Document "
"Type is the SMIL 2.0 Language Profile (<_:ptr-3/>). It contains support for "
"all of the major SMIL 2.0 features including animation, content control, "
"layout, linking, media object, meta-information, structure, timing, and "
"transition effects and is designed for Web clients that support direct "
"playback from SMIL 2.0 markup. SMIL 2.0 (<_:ptr-4/>) became a W3C "
"Recommendation on August 7, 2001, becoming the first vocabulary to provide "
"XML Schema support and to have reached such status."
