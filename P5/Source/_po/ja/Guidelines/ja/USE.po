The mechanisms used to instantiate a TEI schema differ for different schema languages, and are therefore not defined here. In XML DTDs, for example, extensive use is made of parameter entities, while in RELAX NG schemas, extensive use is made of patterns. In either case, the names of elements and, wherever possible, their attributes and content models are defined indirectly. The syntax used to implement this indirection also varies with the schema language used, but the underlying constructs in the TEI Abstract Model are given the same names."
