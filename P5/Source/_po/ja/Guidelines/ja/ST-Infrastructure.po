msgid "This chapter describes the infrastructure for the encoding scheme defined by these Guidelines. It introduces the conceptual framework within which the following chapters are to be understood, and the means by which that conceptual framework is implemented. It assumes some familiarity with XML and XML schemas (see chapter <_:ptr-1/>) but is intended to be accessible to any user of these Guidelines. Other chapters supply further technical details, in particular chapter <_:ptr-2/> which describes the XML schema used to express these Guidelines themselves, and chapter <_:ptr-3/> which combines a discussion of modification and conformance issues with a description of the intended behaviour of an ODD processor; these chapters should be read by anyone intending to implement a new TEI-based system."

Part of an element's declaration includes its assignment to one or more element <_:term-2/>. Another part defines its possible content and attributes with reference to these classes. This indirection gives the TEI system much of its strength and its flexibility. Elements may be combined more or less freely to form a <_:term-3/> appropriate to a particular set of requirements. It is also easy to add new elements which reference existing classes or elements to a schema, as it is to exclude some of the elements provided by any module included in a schema."

However, certain TEI modules are of particular importance, and should always be included in all but exceptional circumstances: the module <_:ident-1/> described in the present chapter is of this kind because it defines classes, macros, and datatypes which are used by all other modules. The <_:ident-2/> module, defined in chapter <_:ptr-3/> contains declarations for elements and attributes which are likely to be needed in almost any kind of document, and is therefore recommended for global use. The <_:ident-4/> module defined in chapter <_:ptr-5/> provides declarations for the metadata elements and attributes constituting the TEI header, a component which is required for TEI conformance, while the <_:ident-6/> module defined in chapter <_:ptr-7/> declares basic structural elements needed for the encoding of most book-like objects. Most schemas will therefore need to include these four modules."

Stylesheets for maintaining and processing ODD documents are maintained by the TEI, and these Guidelines are also maintained as such a document.

If a model class has a name containing <_:val-1/>, such as <_:ident-2/> or <_:ident-3/> then it is primarily defined in terms of its structural location. For example, those elements (or classes of element) which appear as content of a <_:gi-4/> constitute the <_:ident-5/> class; those which appear as content of a <_:gi-6/> constitute the <_:ident-7/> class. If, however, a model class has a name containing <_:val-8/>, such as <_:ident-9/> or <_:ident-10/>, the implication is that its members all have some additional semantic property in common, for example containing a bibliographic description, or containing some form of name, respectively. These semantically-motivated classes often provide a useful way of dividing up large structurally-motivated classes: for example, the very general structural class <_:ident-11/> (<_:soCalled-12/>) has four semantically-motivated member classes (<_:ident-13/>, <_:ident-14/>, <_:ident-15/>, and <_:ident-16/>), the last of these being itself a superclass with several members."

msgid "Where identifiers are defined externally, for example as part of a database or file system, the inability to include whitespace or other special characters in a value may be problematic. In other cases, it may also be simply more convenient to supply a short sequence of natural language words including spaces as a single value. For these reasons, we also provide a datatype <_:ident-1/> which does permit whitespace and indeed any other Unicode character. Legal values include <_:val-2/>, <_:val-3/>, <_:val-4/>, <_:val-5/>, <_:val-6/>, and <_:val-7/>. This datatype should be used with care since XML will not normalize whitespace characters within it: for example the values <_:code-8/> (two spaces) and <_:code-9/> (three spaces) would be considered distinct. This case should be distinguished from that of an attribute permitting multiple values, each of which may be separated by whitespace which <_:emph-10/> be normalized (see further <_:ptr-11/>)."
