"Chapter <_:ptr-1/> introduced the fundamental notions of language "
"identification and character representation in an encoded TEI document. In "
"this chapter we discuss some additional issues relating to the way that "
"written language is represented in a TEI document. In sections <_:ptr-2/> "
"and <_:ptr-3/> we introduce markup which may be used to represent and "
"document non-standard characters, that is, written symbols for which no "
"codepoint exists in Unicode. The same markup may be used to annotate "
"existing characters according to their visual or other properties, and thus "
"process them as distinct glyphs (see section <_:ptr-4/>), or to define new "
"characters or glyphs (section <_:ptr-5/>). We also provide recommendations "
"concerning the Unicode Private Use Area (<_:ptr-6/>. Finally, in section <_:"
"ptr-7/> we discuss ways of documenting the writing mode used in a source "
"text, that is, the directionality of the script, the orientation of "
"individual characters, and related questions."

"Since the need to use these constructs to annotate or define characters "

"In some circumstances, it may be desirable to provide a single precomposed "

"lowercase letter Y with a dot and an acute-accent above it may be "

"The scripts used for writing human languages vary not only in the glyphs "

"arranged as a series of lines which are to be read from top to bottom. "
"Within each line, individual characters are frequently presented from left "
"to right (English, Russian, Greek), but there are also several widely-used "
"scripts which run right-to-left (Arabic, Hebrew). Writing in which the lines "
"of glyphs are presented vertically and read from right to left is also often "
"encountered, notably in East Asian scripts (Sinitic characters, Japanese "
"Kana, Korean Hangul, Vietnamese chữ nôm). In many cases, a language normally "

"individual glyphs within a line and the order in which glyphs and lines "
"should be read), but there are exceptions in which the same language may "

"Many East Asian scripts were traditionally written from top to bottom within "
"the line, with their lines sequenced from right to left. Although modern "
"Japanese, Chinese, and Korean are often written horizontally, the "
"traditional vertical writing mode is still widely used. There are also "

"vertical mode comma. This ensures that the comma appears in the correct "

"encountered in particular contexts; for example when a language using Roman "
"script is embedded within vertically-organized Chinese text, it may "
"sometimes be displayed vertically and sometimes horizontally. The writing "
