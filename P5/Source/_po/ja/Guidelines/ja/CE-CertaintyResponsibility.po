The value of the <_:att-2/> attribute is an XPath expression using the syntax defined in <_:ptr-3/>. In the following example, we wish to indicate a low degree of confidence that the <_:gi-4/> elements used throughout the whole document have been correctly applied: <_:egXML-5/> No <_:att-6/> has been supplied here, and so by default the <_:gi-7/> expressed would therefore apply to the parent element. However, in this case the XPath supplied as the value for <_:att-8/> returns a set of all the <_:gi-9/> elements in the document, independent of the current context. By contrast, in the following example <_:egXML-10/> only the <_:gi-11/> elements within the second <_:gi-12/> element are in question. Similarly, we may indicate that we have more confidence in the <_:gi-13/> tagging within those <_:gi-14/> elements which have a <_:att-15/> value of <_:code-16/>: <_:egXML-17/> If an element in a document is matched by more than one match expression, then the most specific pattern applies. <_:note-18/> As a simple case, if both the preceding <_:gi-19/> elements were present in the same document, a <_:gi-20/> occurring within a <_:tag-21/> element would potentially match both pattern expressions. However because the second pattern is more specific than the former, in fact this is the only one that would apply.
