"The module described in this chapter is intended for use with a wide variety "
"of transcribed spoken material. It should be stressed, however, that the "
"present proposals are not intended to support unmodified every variety of "
"research undertaken upon spoken material now or in the future; some "
"discourse analysts, some phonologists, and doubtless others may wish to "
"extend the scheme presented here to express more precisely the set of "
"distinctions they wish to draw in their transcriptions. Speech regarded as a "
"purely acoustic phenomenon may well require different methods from those "
"outlined here, as may speech regarded solely as a process of social "
"interaction."

"There is great variation in the ways different researchers have chosen to "
"represent speech using the written medium.<_:note-1/> This reflects the "
"special difficulties which apply to the encoding or <_:term-2/> of speech. "
"Speech varies according to a large number of dimensions, many of which have "
"no counterpart in writing (for example, tempo, loudness, pitch, etc.). The "
"audibility of speech recorded in natural communication situations is often "
"less than perfect, affecting the accuracy of the transcription. Spoken "
"material may be transcribed in the course of linguistic, acoustic, "
"anthropological, psychological, ethnographic, journalistic, or many other "
"types of research. Even in the same field, the interests and theoretical "
"perspectives of different transcribers may lead them to prefer different "
"levels of detail in the transcript and different styles of visual display. "
"The production and comprehension of speech are intimately bound up with the "
"situation in which speech occurs, far more so than is the case for written "
"texts. A speech transcript must therefore include some contextual features; "
"determining which are relevant is not always simple. Moreover, the ethical "
"problems in recording and making public what was produced in a private "
"setting and intended for a limited audience are more frequently encountered "
"in dealing with spoken texts than with written ones."

"Speech also poses difficult structural problems. Unlike a written text, a "
"speech event takes place in time. Its beginning and end may be hard to "
"determine and its internal composition difficult to define. Most researchers "
"agree that the utterances or <_:term-1/> of individual speakers form an "
"important structural component in most kinds of speech, but these are rarely "
"as well-behaved (in the structural sense) as paragraphs or other analogous "
"units in written texts: speakers frequently interrupt each other, use "
"gestures as well as words, leave remarks unfinished and so on. Speech "
"itself, though it may be represented as words, frequently contains items "
"such as vocalized pauses which, although only semi-lexical, have immense "
"importance in the analysis of spoken text. Even non-vocal elements such as "
"gestures may be regarded as forming a component of spoken text for some "
"analytic purposes. Below the level of the individual utterance, speech may "
"be segmented into units defined by phonological, prosodic, or syntactic "
"phenomena; no clear agreement exists, however, even as to appropriate names "
"for such segments."

"A common requirement in transcribing spoken language is to mark positions at "

"The recommendations made here only concern the establishment of a basic "
"text. Where a more sophisticated analysis is needed, more sophisticated "
"methods of markup will also be appropriate, for example, using stand-off "
"markup to indicate multiple segmentation of the stream of discourse, or "
"complex alignment of several segments within it. Where additional "
"annotations (sometimes called <_:soCalled-1/> or <_:soCalled-2/>) are used "
"to represent such features as linguistic word class (noun, verb, etc.), type "
"of speech act (imperative, concessive, etc.), or information status (theme/"
"rheme, given/new, active/semi-active/new), etc., a selection from the "
"general purpose analytic tools discussed in chapters <_:ptr-3/>, <_:ptr-4/>, "
