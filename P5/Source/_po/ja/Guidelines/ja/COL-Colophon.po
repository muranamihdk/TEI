"The text of this manual was prepared electronically on a variety of systems. "
"Most sections were originally drafted by members of the work groups and "
"working committees of the TEI; all have been revised by the editors to "
"achieve greater uniformity of style and greater consistency in the tag set."

"The web release of the Guidelines was created using a library of XSLT "
"stylesheets to convert to XHTML; the PDF version for printing was produced "
"by conversion to LaTeX markup, processed using XeLaTeX. The XSLT libraries "

"Almost every available SGML and XML editor or processing program has been "
"used at one time or another by the TEI; but without the open source "
"implementations of XML parsers, editors and XSLT engines by James Clark, "
"Richard Stallman, Michael Kay, and Daniel Veillard, the TEI could not "
"survive, and we thank these individuals. We would also like to thank the "
"staff at SyncRO Soft SRL, creators of the oXygen editor, for their support "
"for the TEI during the creation on P5."
