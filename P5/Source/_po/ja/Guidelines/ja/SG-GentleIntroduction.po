msgid "The encoding scheme defined by these Guidelines is formulated as an application of the Extensible Markup Language (XML) (<_:ptr-1/>). XML is widely used for the definition of device-independent, system-independent methods of storing and processing texts in electronic form. It is now also the interchange and communication format used by many applications on the World Wide Web. In the present chapter we informally introduce some of its basic concepts and attempt to explain to the reader encountering them for the first time how and why they are used in the TEI scheme. More detailed technical accounts of TEI practice in this respect are provided in chapters <_:ptr-2/>, <_:ptr-3/>, and <_:ptr-4/> of these Guidelines."

msgid "Strictly speaking, XML is a <_:term-1/>, that is, a language used to describe other languages, in this case, <_:term-2/> languages. Historically, the word <_:term-3/> has been used to describe annotation or other marks within a text intended to instruct a compositor or typist how a particular passage should be printed or laid out. Examples include wavy underlining to indicate boldface, special symbols for passages to be omitted or printed in a particular font, and so forth. As the formatting and printing of texts was automated, the term was extended to cover all sorts of special codes inserted into electronic texts to govern formatting, printing, or other processing."

Of course, all printed texts are implicitly encoded (or marked up) in this sense: punctuation marks, capitalization, disposition of letters around the page, even the spaces between words all might be regarded as a kind of markup, the purpose of which is to help the human reader determine where one word ends and another begins, or how to identify gross structural features such as headings or simple syntactic units such as dependent clauses or sentences. Encoding a text for computer processing is, in principle, like transcribing a manuscript from <_:foreign-3/><_:note-4/>; it is a process of making explicit what is conjectural or implicit, a process of directing the user as to how the content of the text should be (or has been) interpreted."

Clearly, however, if we wish to exchange our poems with others, or to include poems others have marked up in our anthology, we will need to know a bit more about the names used for the tags. The means that XML provides for this is called a <_:term-1/>. In our simple example, the tags just contain a simple name. As we shall see, it is also possible to use tags that include a <_:term-2/>, that is, a name with an optional prefix identifying the set of names to which it belongs. For example, we have defined an element <_:gi-3/> for the purpose of marking lines of verse. Another person might, however, define an element called <_:gi-4/> for the purpose of marking typographic lines, or drawn lines. Because of these different meanings, if we wish to share data it will be necessary to distinguish the two <_:q-5/> components in our marked-up texts. This is achieved by including a <_:term-6/> within the markup, for example like this: <_:eg-7/> This feature is particularly important if we have different definitions of what a <_:soCalled-8/> is, of course, but there are many occasions when it is useful to distinguish groups of tags belonging to different <_:soCalled-9/>; we discuss this further below (<_:ptr-10/>). One particularly useful namespace prefix is predefined for XML: it is <_:code-11/> and we will see examples of its use below."

Simple well-formedness alone is not enough for the full range of what might be useful in marking up a document. It might well be useful if, in the process of preparing our digital anthology, a computer system could check some basic rules about how stanzas, lines, and headings can sensibly co-occur in a document. It would be even more useful if the system could check that stanzas are always tagged <_:tag-1/> and not occasionally <_:tag-2/> or <_:tag-3/>. An XML document in which such rules have been checked is technically known as a <_:term-4/> document, and the ability to perform such validation is one of the key advantages of using XML.

msgid "The design of a schema may be as lax or as restrictive as the occasion warrants. A balance must be struck between the convenience of following simple rules and the complexity of handling real texts. This is particularly the case when the rules being defined relate to texts that already exist: the designer may have only the haziest of notions as to an ancient text's original purpose or meaning and hence find it very difficult to specify consistent rules about its structure. On the other hand, where a new text is being prepared to an exact specification, for entry into a textual database of some kind for example, the more precisely stated the rules, the better they can be enforced. Even in the case where an existing text is being marked up, it may be beneficial to define a restrictive set of rules relating to one particular view or hypothesis about the text—if only as a means of testing the usefulness of that view or hypothesis. A schema designed for use by a small project or team is likely to take a different position on such issues than one intended for use by a large and possibly fragmented community. It is important to remember that every schema results from an interpretation of a text. There is no single schema encompassing the absolute truth about any text, although it may be convenient to privilege some schemas above others for particular types of analysis."

In the production of technical documentation, for example, it is of major importance that sections and subsections should be properly nested, that cross-references should be properly resolved and so forth. In such situations, documents are seen as raw material to match against predefined sets of rules. As discussed above, however, the use of simple rules can also greatly simplify the task of tagging accurately elements of less rigidly constrained texts. By making these rules explicit, the scholar reduces his or her own burdens in marking up and verifying the electronic text, while also being forced to make explicit an interpretation of the structure and significant particularities of the text being encoded."

The meaning of a pattern is expressed in a schema by reference to other patterns, or to a small number of built-in fundamental concepts, as we shall see. In the example above, the word to the left of the equals sign is the pattern's name, and the material following it declares a meaning for the pattern. Patterns may also be of particular types; the ones that interest us here are called <_:term-2/> and <_:term-3/>. In this example we see definitions for five element patterns. Note that we have used similar names for the pattern and the element which the pattern describes: so, for example, the line <_:code-4/> defines an element pattern called <_:code-5/>, the value of which defines an element called <_:code-6/>. These naming conventions are arbitrary; we could use the same name for the pattern as for the element, since the two are syntactically quite distinct.

In RELAX NG the opposite approach was taken, in that all datatype validation, whether of attributes or element content, is regarded as external to the schema language. For attributes, as we have seen, RELAX NG makes use of the W3C Schema Datatype Library (but permits use of others). Because RELAX NG treats both elements and attributes as special cases of patterns, the same datatype validation facilities are available for element content as for attribute values; it is unlike other schema languages in this respect. In addition, for content validation, a different component of DSDL known as Schematron can be used. Schematron is a pattern matching (rather than a grammar-based) language, which allows us to test the components of a document against templates that express constraints such as those mentioned above."
