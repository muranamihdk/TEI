However, it must be emphasized that these recommendations do not provide for the full range of possible graphical representations, and deal only partially with questions of design, layout, and placement."

An undirected graph is a set of <_:term-3/> (or <_:term-4/>) together with a set of pairs of those vertices, called <_:term-5/> or <_:term-6/>. Each node in an arc of an undirected graph is said to be <_:term-7/> with that arc, and the two vertices (nodes) which make up an arc are said to be <_:term-8/>. An directed graph is like an undirected graph except that the arcs are <_:term-9/> of nodes. In the case of directed graphs, the term <_:term-10/> is not used; moreover, each arc in a directed graph is said to be <_:term-11/> the node from which the arc emanates, and <_:term-12/> the node to which the arc is directed. We use the element <_:gi-13/> to encode graphs as a whole, <_:gi-14/> to encode nodes or vertices, and <_:gi-15/> to encode arcs or edges; arcs can also be encoded by attributes on the <_:gi-16/> element.

That is, it is possible in a tree graph to follow a path from any vertex to any other vertex, but there are no paths that lead from any vertex to itself. A rooted tree is a directed graph based on a tree; that is, the arcs in the graph correspond to the arcs of a tree such that there is exactly one node, called the <_:term-2/>, for which there is a path from that node to all other nodes in the graph. For our purposes, we may ignore all trees except for rooted trees, and hence we shall use the <_:gi-3/> element for rooted trees, and the <_:gi-4/> element for its root. The nodes adjacent to a given node are called its <_:term-5/>, and the node adjacent from a given node is called its <_:term-6/>. Nodes with both a parent and children are called <_:term-7/>, for which we use the <_:gi-8/> element. A node with no children is tagged as a <_:gi-9/>. If the children of a node are ordered from left to right, then we say that that node is <_:term-10/>. If all the nodes of a tree are ordered, then we say that the tree is an <_:term-11/>. If some of the nodes of a tree are ordered and others are not, then the tree is a <_:term-12/>. The ordering of nodes and trees may be specified by an attribute; we take the default ordering for trees to be ordered, that roots inherit their ordering from the trees in which they occur, and internal nodes inherit their ordering from their parents. Finally, we permit a node to be specified as following other nodes, which (when its parent is ordered) it would be assumed to precede, giving rise to crossing arcs. The elements used for the encoding of trees have the following descriptions and attributes. <_:specList-13/>"

msgid "The nodes in this stemma represent manuscripts; each has a label (a letter) which identifies it and also distinguishes whether the manuscript is extant, lost, or hypothetical. Extant manuscripts are identified by uppercase Latin letters or words beginning with uppercase Latin letters, e.g., <_:val-1/>, shown as aqua in this example; manuscripts no longer existing, but providing readings which are attested e.g. by note or copy made before their disappearance, are identified by lowercase Latin letters, e.g., <_:val-2/>, shown as magenta in this example; hypothetical stages in the textual transmission, which do not necessarily correspond to real manuscripts, are given lowercase Greek letters, e.g., <_:val-3/> and shown as gold in this example. The stemma shown above thus suggests that (on the basis of similarities in the readings of the extant and lost manuscripts) <_:val-4/> and <_:val-5/> share textual material that is not shared with other manuscripts (represented in this case by <_:val-6/>) even though no physical manuscript attesting this stage in the textual transmission has ever been identified."

msgid "This familiar tree model is complicated because manuscripts sometimes show the influence of more than one ancestor. They may have been produced by a scribe who checked the text in one manuscript of the same work whilst copying from another, or perhaps made changes from his memory of a slightly different version of the text that he had read elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps scribe A copied a manuscript from one source, scribe B made changes in it in the margins or between the lines (either by consulting another source directly or from memory), and another scribe then copied that manuscript, incorporating the changes into the body. Whatever the specific scenario, it is not uncommon for a manuscript to be based primarily on one source, but to incorporate features of another branch of the tradition. This mixed result is called <_:term-1/>, and it is reflected in a stemma by a dotted line. Thus, the example above asserts that <_:val-2/> is copied within the <_:val-3/> tradition, but is also contaminated from the <_:val-4/> tradition."

A tradition completely without contamination (called a <_:term-1/>) yields a classic tree, easily represented graphically by a stemma. An <_:term-2/>, with substantial contamination, yields a spaghetti-like stemma characterized by crossing dotted lines, which is both difficult to read and not very informative."

msgid "The <_:gi-1/> element introduced in this chapter can be used to represent a closed tradition in a straightforward manner.

A <_:gi-4/> element provides a way of identifying each node, complementary to the global attributes <_:att-5/> and <_:att-6/> attributes. For example, the closed part of the tradition headed by the label δ may be encoded as follows: <_:egXML-7/> To complete this representation, we need to show that the node labelled A is not derived solely from its parent node (labelled ε) but also demonstrates contamination from the node labelled γ. The easiest way to accomplish this is to include an appropriately-typed <_:gi-8/> element within the node in question, the <_:att-9/> of which points to the node labelled γ. This requires that this latter node be supplied with a value for its <_:att-10/> attribute. The complete representation is thus: <_:egXML-11/>"
