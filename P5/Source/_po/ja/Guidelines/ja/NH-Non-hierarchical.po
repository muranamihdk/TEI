"third view, the <_:soCalled-7/>, might concentrate on narrative voice: "
"distinguishing between the narrator and their interlocutors and identifying "
"individual segments as direct quotations. In our examples, we will restrict "
"ourselves to relatively simple conflicts: for the <_:term-8/> we will encode "
"only metrical lines and line groups; for the <_:term-9/> we will restrict "

"Most markup is characterized by the embedding of elements in the text. An "
"alternative approach separates the text and the elements used to describe "
"it. This approach is known as stand-off markup (see section <_:ptr-1/>). It "
"establishes a new hierarchy by building a new tree whose nodes are XML "
"elements that do not contain textual content, but rather links to another <_:"
"term-2/>: <_:gloss-3/>. This approach can be subdivided according to "
"different criteria. A first distinction concerns the link base, i.e. the "
"content to which annotations are to be applied. Sometimes the link target "
"contains markup that can be referred to explicitly, as in the following "
"example where the offset markup uses the <_:att-4/> values on <_:gi-5/> to "
"provide targets for <_:gi-6/><_:note-7/>: <_:egXML-8/> Note that the layer "

"This is very similar to the use of <_:gi-1/> discussed above. The main "

"e. does not have any XML encoding. In this case, the range of text to be "

"<_:ptr-4/>). Another distinction concerns the number of files which can "
