"This chapter is organized as follows. Following this introduction, section "
"<_:ptr-1/> introduces the elements <_:gi-2/> and <_:gi-3/>, used to "
"represent feature structures and features respectively, together with the "
"elementary <_:term-4/> feature value. Section <_:ptr-5/> introduces elements "
"for representing other kinds of atomic feature values such as <_:term-6/>, "
"<_:term-7/>, and <_:term-8/> values. Section <_:ptr-9/> introduces the "
"notion of predefined <_:term-10/> or groups of features or feature values "
"along with methods for referencing their components. Section <_:ptr-11/> "
"introduces complex values, in particular feature-structures as values, thus "
"enabling feature structures to be recursively defined. Section <_:ptr-12/> "
"discusses other complex values, in particular values which are collections, "
"organized as <_:term-13/>s, <_:term-14/>s, and <_:term-15/>s. Section <_:"
"ptr-16/> discusses how the operations of alternation, negation, and "
"collection of feature values may be represented. Section <_:ptr-17/> "
"discusses ways of representing underspecified, default, or uncertain values. "
"Section <_:ptr-18/> discusses how analyses may be linked to other parts of "
"an encoded text. Section <_:ptr-19/> describes the <_:term-20/>, a construct "
"which provides for the validation of typed feature structures. Formal "
"definitions for all the elements introduced in this chapter are provided in "
"section <_:ptr-21/>."

"feature structures containing valid combinations of feature values are used, "
"one can put definitions for all valid feature structures inside a <_:term-6/"

"Such constraints on valid feature structures are expressed as a series of "
"conditional and biconditional tests in the <_:gi-1/> part of an <_:gi-2/>. A "
"particular feature structure is valid only if it meets all the constraints. "
"The <_:gi-3/> element encodes the conventional if-then conditional of "
"boolean logic which succeeds when both the antecedent and consequent are "
"true, or whenever the antecedent is false. The <_:gi-4/> element encodes the "
"biconditional (if and only if) operation of boolean logic. It succeeds only "
"when the corresponding if-then conditionals in both directions are true. In "
"feature structure constraints the antecedent and consequent are expressed as "
"feature structures; they are considered true if they <_:term-5/> (see "
"section <_:ptr-6/>) the feature structure in question, but in the case of "
"consequents, this truth is asserted rather than simply tested. That is to "
"say, a conditional is enforced by determining that the antecedent does not "
"(and will never) subsume the given feature structure, or by determining that "
"the antecedent does subsume the given feature structure, and then unifying "
"the consequent with it (the result of which, if successful, will be subsumed "
"by the consequent). In practice, the enforcement of such constraints can "
"result in periods in which the truth of a constraint with respect to a given "
"feature structure is simply not known; in this case, the constraint must be "
"persistently monitored as the feature structure becomes more informative "
"until either its truth value is determined or computation fails for some "
"other reason."
