"Nevertheless, however large the number of standardized characters, there "
"will always be a need to encode documents which use non-standard characters "
"and glyphs, particularly but not exclusively in historical material. The "

"compatibility with <_:soCalled-1/> data was an additional disincentive. "
"Eventually, tension in East Asia between commitment to technological "
"progress and the inability of existing computers to cope with local writing "
"systems led to decisive developments. Japanese, Korean, and Chinese "

"The principles of Unicode are judiciously tempered with pragmatism. This "
"means, among other things, that the actual repertoire of characters which "
"the standard encodes, especially those parts dating from its earlier days, "
"include a number of items which on a strict interpretation of the Unicode "
"Consortium's theoretical approach should not have been regarded as abstract "
"characters in their own right. Some of these characters are grouped together "
"into a code-point regions assigned to <_:term-1/>. Ligatures are a case in "
"point. Ligatures (e.g. the joining of adjacent lowercase letters <_:q-2/> "
"and <_:q-3/> or <_:q-4/> and <_:q-5/> in Latin scripts, whether produced by "
"a scribal practice of not lifting the pen between strokes or dictated by the "
"aesthetics of a type design) are representational features with no added "
"semantic value beyond that of the two letters they unite (though for "
"historians of typography their presence and form in a given edition may be "
"of scholarly significance). However, by the time the Unicode standard was "
"first being debated, it had become common practice to include single glyphs "
"representing the more common ligatures in the repertoires of some "
"typesetting devices and high-end printers, and for the coded character sets "
"built into those devices to use a single code point for such glyphs, even "
"though they represent two distinct abstract characters. So as to increase "
"the acceptance of Unicode among the makers and users of such devices, it was "
"agreed that some such pseudo-characters should be incorporated into the "
"standard as compatibility characters. Nevertheless, if a project requires "
"the presence of such ligatured forms to be encoded, this should normally be "
"done via markup, not by the use of a compatibility character. That way, the "
"presence of the ligature can still be identified (and, if desired, rendered "
"visually) where appropriate, but indexing and retrieval software will treat "
"the code points in the document as a simple sequential occurrence of the two "
"constituent characters concerned and so correctly align their semantics with "
"non-ligatured equivalents. Such ligatures should not be confused with "
"digraphs (usually) indicating diphthongs, as in the French word \"cœur\". A "
"digraph is an atomic orthographic unit representing an abstract character in "
"its own right, not purely an amalgamation of glyphs, and indexing and "
"retrieval software will need to treat it as such. Where a digraph occurs in "
"a source text, it should normally be encoded using the appropriate code "
"point for the single abstract character which it represents."

"The treatment of characters with diacritical marks within Unicode shows a "
"similar combination of rigour and pragmatism. It is obvious enough that it "
"would be feasible to represent many characters with diacritical marks in "
"Latin and some other scripts by a sequence of code points, where one code "
"point designated the base character and the remainder represented one or "
"more diacritical marks that were to be combined with the base character to "
"produce an appropriate glyphic rendering of the abstract character "
"concerned. From its earliest phase, the Unicode Consortium espoused this "
"view in theory but was prepared in practice to compromise by assigning "
"single code points to <_:term-1/> characters which were already commonly "
"assigned a single distinctive code point in existing encoding schemes. This "
"means, however, that for quite a large number of commonly-occurring abstract "
"characters, Unicode has two different, but logically and semantically "
"equivalent encodings: a <_:term-2/> single code point, and a code point "
"sequence of a base character plus one or more <_:term-3/> diacritics. "
"Scripts more recently added to Unicode no longer exhibit this code-point "
"duplication (in current practice no new precomposed characters are defined "
"where the use of combining characters is possible) but this does nothing to "
"remove the problem caused by the duplications from older character sets that "
"have been permanently embodied in Unicode. Together with essentially "
"analogous issues arising from the encoding of certain East Asian ideographs. "
"This duplication gives rise to the need to practice <_:term-4/> of Unicode "
"documents. Normalization is the process of ensuring that a given abstract "
"character is represented in one way only in a given Unicode document or "
"document collection. The Unicode Consortium provides four standard "
"normalization forms, of which the <_:term-5/> (NFC) seems to be most "
"appropriate for text encoding projects. The NFC, as far as possible, defines "
"conversions for all base characters followed by one or more combining "
"characters into the corresponding precomposed characters. The World Wide Web "
