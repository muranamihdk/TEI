"The term <_:term-1/> is used to mean a number of rather different things. It "
"may refer simply to any collection of linguistic data (for example, written, "
"spoken, signed, or multimodal), although many practitioners prefer to "
"reserve it for collections which have been organized or collected with a "
"particular end in view, generally to characterize a particular state or "
"variety of one or more languages. Because opinions as to the best method of "
"achieving this goal differ, various subcategories of corpora have also been "
"identified. For our purposes however, the distinguishing characteristic of a "
"corpus is that its components have been selected or structured according to "
"some conscious set of design criteria."

"These design criteria may be very simple and undemanding, or very "
"sophisticated. A corpus may be intended to represent (in the statistical "
"sense) a particular linguistic variety or sublanguage, or it may be intended "
"to represent all aspects of some assumed <_:soCalled-1/> language. A corpus "
"may be made up of whole texts or of fragments or text samples. It may be a "
"<_:soCalled-2/> corpus, or an <_:soCalled-3/> or <_:soCalled-4/> corpus, the "
"composition of which may change over time. However, since an open corpus is "
"of necessity finite at any particular point in time, the only likely effect "
"of its expansibility from the encoding point of view may be some increased "
"difficulty in maintaining consistent encoding practices (see further section "
"<_:ptr-5/>). For simplicity, therefore, our discussion largely concerns ways "
"of encoding closed corpora, regarded as single but composite texts."

"Language corpora are regarded by these Guidelines as <_:term-1/> rather than "
"<_:term-2/> (on this distinction, see chapter <_:ptr-3/>). This is because "
"although each discrete sample of language in a corpus clearly has a claim to "
"be considered as a text in its own right, it is also regarded as a "
"subdivision of some larger object, if only for convenience of analysis. "
"Corpora share a number of characteristics with other types of composite "
"texts, including anthologies and collections. Most notably, different "
"components of composite texts may exhibit different structural properties "
"(for example, some may be composed of verse, and others of prose), thus "
"potentially requiring elements from different TEI modules."

"Aside from these high-level structural differences, and possibly differences "
"of scale, the encoding of language corpora and the encoding of individual "
"texts present identical sets of problems. Any of the encoding techniques and "
"elements presented in other chapters of these Guidelines may therefore prove "
"relevant to some aspect of corpus encoding and may be used in corpora. "
"Therefore, we do not repeat here the discussion of such fundamental matters "
"as the representation of multiple character sets (see chapter <_:ptr-1/>); "
"nor do we attempt to summarize the variety of elements provided for encoding "
"basic structural features such as quoted or highlighted phrases, cross-"
"references, lists, notes, editorial changes and reference systems (see "
"chapter <_:ptr-2/>). In addition to these general purpose elements, these "
"Guidelines offer a range of more specialized sets of tags which may be of "
"use in certain specialized corpora, for example those consisting primarily "
"of verse (chapter <_:ptr-3/>), drama (chapter <_:ptr-4/>), transcriptions of "
"spoken text (chapter <_:ptr-5/>), etc. Chapter <_:ptr-6/> should be reviewed "
"for details of how these and other components of these Guidelines should be "
"tailored to create a TEI customization appropriate to a given application. "
"In sum, it should not be assumed that only the matters specifically "
"addressed in this chapter are of importance for corpus creators."
