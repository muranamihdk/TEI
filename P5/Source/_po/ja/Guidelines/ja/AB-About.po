"They make recommendations about suitable ways of representing those features "
"of textual resources which need to be identified explicitly in order to "
"facilitate processing by computer programs. In particular, they specify a "
"set of markers (or <_:term-1/>) which may be inserted in the electronic "
"representation of the text, in order to mark the text structure and other "
"features of interest. Many, or most, computer programs depend on the "
"presence of such explicit markers for their functionality, since without "
"them a digitized text appears to be nothing but a sequence of "
"undifferentiated bits. The success of the World Wide Web, for example, is "
"partly a consequence of its use of such markup to indicate such features as "
"headings and lists on individual pages, and to indicate links between pages. "
"The process of inserting such explicit markers for implicit textual features "
"is often called <_:soCalled-2/>, or equivalently within this work <_:"
"soCalled-3/>; the term <_:soCalled-4/> is also used informally. We use the "
"term <_:term-5/> or <_:term-6/> to denote the complete set of rules "
"associated with the use of markup in a given context; we use the term <_:"
"term-7/> for the specific set of markers or named distinctions employed by a "
"given encoding scheme. Thus, this work both describes the TEI encoding "
"scheme, and documents the TEI markup vocabulary."

"publishers and others creating or distributing electronic texts. Although "
"they focus on problems of representing in electronic form texts which "
"already exist in traditional media, these Guidelines are also applicable to "

"resources of all kinds: the Extensible Markup Language (XML), as defined by "
"the World Wide Web Consortium's XML Recommendation. However, the TEI "
"encoding scheme itself does not depend on this language; it was originally "
"formulated in terms of SGML (the ISO Standard Generalized Markup Language), "
"a predecessor of XML, and may in future years be re-expressed in other ways "
"as the field of markup develops and matures. For more information on markup "

"manuscript materials. The next nine chapters deal with a wide range of "
"topics, one or more of which are likely to be of interest in specialist "
"applications of various kinds. The last two chapters deal with the XML "
"encoding used to represent the TEI scheme itself, and provide technical "

"The goal of providing guidance for text encoding suggests that "

"To oversee and manage the revision process in collaboration with the TEI "

"2002 at King's College London. Its first task was to oversee production of "
"an XML version of the TEI Guidelines, updating P3 to enable users to work "

"published in June 2002. It was essentially an XML version of P3, making no "

"important areas not previously addressed including character encoding, "
"graphics, manuscript description, biographical and geographical data, and "
